This monorepo contains test suite that verifies subgraphs compatibility against [Apollo Federation Subgraph Specification](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/subgraph-spec/). This testing suite verifies various Federation features against subgraph implementation. See [compatibility testing docs](./COMPATIBILITY.md) for details on the expected schema and the data sets as well as information about the executed tests. Test suite is packaged as [NPX script](./packages/script/README.md) and [Github Action](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-federation-subgraph-compatibility-action).

This repository also contains number of [example subgraph implementations](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-federation-subgraph-compatibility/tree/main/implementations) based on various libraries and other solutions. See [latest compatibility results](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/building-supergraphs/supported-subgraphs) for a list of Apollo Federation compatibible subgraph implementations.
