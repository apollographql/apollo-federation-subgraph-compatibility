# Apollo Federation Subgraph Library Compatibility Testing Strategy

The purpose of this repository is to provide a centralized strategy focused on understanding a given subgraph library's compatibility against the [Apollo Federation Specification](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/federation-spec/). 

## Latest Results

The following open-source GraphQL server libraries provide support for Apollo Federation and are included in our test suite.

_*_ Implementation does not support multiple `@key` definitions, but all types of `@key` definitions are supported

## Testing Suite

This repository contains a structured testing suite based on a federated schema that covers the [Apollo Federation Specification](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/federation-spec/). The federated schema is constructued of 3 subgraphs (`users`, `inventory` and `products`) that will be started and used to test various libraries that support Apollo Federation. The `users` and `inventory` subgraphs are provided by this repository in addition to the graph router instance. Library implementors will each implement the `products` schema and provide a docker file that can be used with `docker compose`; templates for these files are provided along with examples.

## Subgraph Schemas

### Users

```graphql
type User @key(fields: "email") {
  email: ID!
  name: String
  totalProductsCreated: Int
}
```

### Inventory

```graphql
extend type Product @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID! @external
  dimensions: ProductDimension @external
  delivery(zip: String): DeliveryEstimates
    @requires(fields: "dimensions { size weight }")
}

type ProductDimension {
  size: String
  weight: Float
}

type DeliveryEstimates {
  estimatedDelivery: String
  fastestDelivery: String
}
```

### Products (schema to be implemented by library maintainers)

```graphql
type Product
  @key(fields: "id")
  @key(fields: "sku package")
  @key(fields: "sku variation { id }") {
  id: ID!
  sku: String
  package: String
  variation: ProductVariation
  dimensions: ProductDimension

  createdBy: User @provides(fields: "totalProductsCreated")
}

type ProductVariation {
  id: ID!
}

type ProductDimension {
  size: String
  weight: Float
}

extend type Query {
  product(id: ID!): Product
}

extend type User @key(fields: "email") {
  email: ID! @external
  totalProductsCreated: Int @external
}
```

## Testing Spec Compliance

- `_service` - support a `rover subgraph introspect` command (this is the Apollo Federation equivalent of Introspection for subgraphs)
  - `query { _service { sdl } }`
- `@key` and `_entities` - support defining a single `@key`, multiple `@key` definitionss, multiple-fields `@key` and a complex fields `@key`. Below is an example of the single `@key` query that is sent from the graph router to the implementing `products` subgraph (the variables will be changed to test all `@key` definitions):

```graphql
query ($representations: [_Any!]!) {
    _entities(representations: [{ "__typename": "Product", "id": "apollo-federation" }]) {
        ...on Product {sku package variation { id } dimensions { size weight }
        }
    }
}
```

- @requires - support defining complex fields
  - This will be tested through a query covering [Product.delivery](http://product.delivery) where the library implementors dimensions { size weight } will need to be an expected { size: "1", weight: 1 } to pass. Example query that will be sent directly to `products` subgraph.

```graphql
query ($id: ID!) {
  product(id: $id) {
    dimensions {
      size
      weight
    }
  }
}
```

- @provides - This will be covered by the library implementors at Product.createdBy where they will be expected to provide the User.totalProductsCreated to be _anything_ _other than 4_

```graphql
query ($id: ID!) {
  product(id: $id) {
    createdBy {
      email
      totalProductsCreated
    }
  }
}
```

- @external - This is covered in the tests above.
- `extends` or `@extends` - This is covered in the `products` subgraph extension of the `User`
- `ftv1` (Federated Traces version 1) - A query with the `apollo-federated-include-trace:ftv1` header will be sent to the `products` subgraph which should return a value for the `extensions.ftv1` in the result.
  - _NOTE: In the initial release of this testing strategy, we will not be validating `ftv1` to ensure it's in the proper format_

## Setting up the testing suite

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run setup`
   - `npm run build` - compiles typescript code and composes supergraph SDL
   - `npm run docker` - build docker images for `graph-router`, `users` and `inventory`

## Running the Test

`npm run test` will test all folders in the `implementations` folder. You can provide a comma separated string as an additional argument to test only specific libraries.

## Test Results

A `results.md` file will be created that displays the testing results
