# Apollo Federation Library Maintainers Implementation Guide

This document provides Apollo Federation Library Maintainers with the
necessary information to test their library against The Apollo Federation Spec.

## Why should I even do this?

You've built a library and that should be celebrated! We want to build a
stronger community around Apollo Federation and that includes us supporting you
as a core maintainer! The Apollo Federation spec can potentially change over
time along with each implementing libraries `graphql` implementation (`graphql-js`
vs `graphql-ruby` for example). This test suite should help identify scenarios
where something is not working as expected early and Apollo can help provide
guidance on what specifically might need to change.

Dependabot will be setup in the near future to ensure that any changes to
underlying packages will rerun the test suite and open an issue if there are
any regressions.

## How can I have my library included in this?

It's actually pretty easy! We have a `products` schema that you will need to
implement to be used in the testing suite:

1. Copy the `implementations/_template_` folder and rename it to the name of
   your library
   - You'll find 4 files that you need in the template folder:
     `metadata.yaml`, `docker-compose.yml`, `Dockerfile` and `products.graphql`
2. Update the `metadata.yaml` file with your project details. These details are used in the main results table in the `README.md` of this repo, and in our [subgraph-compatible libraries](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/other-servers) documentation.
3. You'll need to implement the `products.graphql` file in your server, this is
   the reference implementation
4. Once you have the schema implemented, you'll need to modify the `Dockerfile`
   to make your server a Docker image and expose it on port 4001
   - We will send traffic to `http://products:4001`, if your server has
     `/graphql` required you'll need to change it
5. You most likely don't need to modify the `docker-compose.yml` file, but it
   will be used for `docker compose` to test your implementation. If you do need
   to edit the `docker-compose.yml` file, your edits should only affect the
   `products` service defined.
6. Test only your library by running `npm run setup` and `npm run test {YOUR_IMPLEMENTATION_FOLDER_NAME}`
   and the results will be outputted to `results.md`

### Expected Data Sets

Below is data that is used in this testing strategy and what you should be using
in your server (it is okay to return hardcoded results, this is what is done in
`apollo-server` and `federation-jvm`).

```javascript
const products = [
  {
    id: "apollo-federation",
    sku: "federation",
    package: "@apollo/federation",
    variation: "OSS",
  },
  {
    id: "apollo-studio",
    sku: "studio",
    package: "",
    variation: "platform",
  },
];

const users = [
  {
    email: "support@apollographql.com",
    name: "Apollo Studio Support",
    totalProductsCreated: 1337,
  },
];
```

## Debugging at the command line

Running the federated graph for a single implementation:

```sh
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml -f implementations/${LIBRARY_NAME}/docker-compose.yaml up --build
```

With the containers running, you can also run the tests:

```sh
npm run test:jest
```

When running the test runner with `npm run test`, test failures are written to
the `tmp` directory.

To get verbose output when running the test runner, add a `DEBUG` flag like so:

```sh
DEBUG=docker,test npm run test
```

## Debugging in VSCode

There are debugging launch configurations established for all subgraphs provided
to your along with the Graph Router.

In VSCode, you can open the debugger panel and debug any of the following:

- Debug Test - This debugs the actual test suite script
- Debug Users - This launches the `users` `ApolloServer` instance locally
  (not by the docker image). You can set break points in the resolver code as
  needed to explore.
- Debug Inventory - This launches the `inventory` `ApolloServer` instance
  locally (not by the docker image). You can set break points in the resolver
  code as needed to explore

### Debugging other implementations

It is not required to include debugging capabilities for every library, but it
is very helpful. The follow libraries also have debug launch configurations
established:

- Debug Products:apollo-server (TypeScript)
- Debug Products:federation-jvm (Java)
