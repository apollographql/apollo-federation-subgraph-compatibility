`@apollo/federation-subgraph-compatibility` script is an NPM package that allows you to test given subgraph's implementation for compatibility against the [Apollo Federation Subgraph Specification](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/subgraph-spec/). This testing suite verifies various Federation features against subgraph implementation. See [compatibility testing docs](../../COMPATIBILITY.md) for details on the expected schema and the data sets as well as information about the executed tests.

## Installation

Apollo Federation subgraph compatibility test script is published to NPM.

```shell
npm install --dev @apollo/federation-subgraph-compatibility
```

You can execute the script using [NPX](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npx)

```shell
# remote package
npx @apollo/federation-subgraph-compatibility --help

# package installed locally
npx fedtest --help

# package installed globally
fedtest --help
```

## Usage

`@apollo/federation-subgraph-compatibility` test script starts a supergraph that consists of your subgraph implementation, two reference subgraphs and [Apollo Router](https://github.com/apollographql/router). Since script needs to manage multiple processes, you need to specify which process management technology should be used to run the tests. Currently script supports [PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

```shell
npx fedtest --help
Usage: fedtest [options] [command]

Run Apollo Federation subgraph compatibility tests

Options:
  -V, --version             output the version number
  -h, --help                display help for command

Commands:
  pm2 [options]             Start supergraph using PM2
  docker [options]          Start supergraph using Docker Compose
  help [options] [command]  display help for command
```

### PM2

[PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/) is a Node based process manager. When tests are run using `pm2` command, script will start the supergraph using [Apollo Rover](https://github.com/apollographql/rover) `dev` command.

```shell
npx fedtest pm2 --help
Usage: fedtest pm2 [options]

Start supergraph using PM2

Options:
  --config <subgraph.config.js>  optional PM2 configuration file
  --debug                        debug mode with extra log info
  --endpoint <url>               subgraph endpoint
  --failOnRequired               boolean flag to indicate whether any failing required test should fail the script.
  --failOnWarning                boolean flag to indicate whether any failing test should fail the script.
  --format <json|markdown>       optional output file format (choices: "json", "markdown", default: "markdown")
  -h, --help                     display help for command
  --quiet                        suppress logging to minimum
  --schema <schema.graphql>      optional path to schema file, if omitted composition will fallback to introspection
```

If your subgraph is already up and running, you can run compatibility tests using PM2 by specifying `--endpoint <url>` option. This will create supergraph that uses introspection to read subgraph schema.

```shell
npx fedtest pm2 --endpoint http://localhost:8080/graphql
```

If you have a subgraph schema available, you can also specify it on the command line. Schema path can be absolute or relative to the current directory.

```shell
npx fedtest pm2 --endpoint http://localhost:8080/graphql --schema /path/to/schema.graphql
```

PM2 can also be used to start your subgraph. You can specify an [ecosystem config file](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/application-declaration/) that contains information how to start your subgraph.

```js
// simple PM2 subgraph config that starts Node application
module.exports = {
    apps : [{
      name   : "subgraph product",
      script : "index.js",
      cwd: "/path/to/your/implementation"
    }]
}
```

```shell
npx fedtest pm2 --endpoint http://localhost:8080/graphql --config /path/to/subgraph.config.js
```

### Docker Compose

[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) is a tool for running multi-container Docker applications. When tests are run using `docker` command, script will compose supergraph using [Apollo Rover](https://github.com/apollographql/rover) `supergraph compose` command and run standalone router image.

```shell
npx fedtest docker --help
Usage: fedtest docker [options]

Start supergraph using Docker Compose

Options:
  --compose <docker-compose.yaml>  Path to docker compose file
  --debug                          debug mode with extra log info
  --failOnRequired                 boolean flag to indicate whether any failing required test should fail the script.
  --failOnWarning                  boolean flag to indicate whether any failing test should fail the script.
  --format <json|markdown>         optional output file format (choices: "json", "markdown", default: "markdown")
  -h, --help                       display help for command
  --path <path>                    GraphQL endpoint path (default: "")
  --port <port>                    HTTP server port (default: "4001")
  --quiet                          suppress logging to minimum
  --schema <schema.graphql>        Path to schema file
```

In order to run compatibility tests using `docker` command, you need to pass both compose file and subgraph schema file.
Paths to files can be absolute or relative to the current working directory.

```shell
npx fedtest docker --compose /path/to/docker-compose.yaml --schema /path/to/schema.graphql
```

Docker Compose file is a YAML configuration file that defines all services, networks and volumes necessary for running your application. For Apollo Federation compatibility tests we require you to define a service called `products` which should expose your GraphQL endpoint at `http://localhost:4001`.

```yaml
services:
  products:
    # must be a relative path to the directory that will be used to run the tests
    # if you are going to run the tests from the same directory as your docker file, then you can specify .
    build: path/to/my-implementation
    # expose ports
    ports:
      - 4001:4001
```

If your application exposes custom path (e.g. `/graphql`) or use different port, make sure to also specify those values as command line arguments.

```shell
# docker compose file starts subgraph exposing http://localhost:8080/graphql
npx fedtest docker --compose /path/to/docker-compose.yaml --schema /path/to/schema.graphql --path /graphql --port 8080
```

For compose file examples, see the example implementations in this repository. For additional details, please refer to the [Docker compose documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/).

### Test Results

Script logs the compatibility test results on the console and also generates corresponding results file. By default, script will generate results in a markdown format. You can change this behavior by specifying and `--format json` option.

```shell
# generate results.json file
npx fedtest pm2 --endpoint http://localhost:8080/graphql --format json
```

### Debug Mode

In order to enable debug mode that provides more verbose logs, specify `--debug` option on the command line.

```shell
npx fedtest pm2 --endpoint http://localhost:8080/graphql --debug
```
