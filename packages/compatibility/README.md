`@apollo/federation-subgraph-compatibility-tests` package contains a testing suite that verifies given subgraph's implementation compatibility with the [Apollo Federation Subgraph Specification](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/subgraph-spec/). See [compatibility testing docs](../../COMPATIBILITY.md) for details on the expected schema and the data sets as well as information about the executed tests. For convenience, this testing suite is packaged as an executable [NPX script](../script/README.md) and a [Github Action](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-federation-subgraph-compatibility-action).
